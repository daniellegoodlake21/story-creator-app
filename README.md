# story-creator-app
An app I created for my sibling to visually play back imaginative stories auickly and easily on a computer.
Please note that this repository only includes the C# files from my Unity project. These alone do not provide the full working app, they only demonstrate skills in C#.
You can create and change:
 1. Characters (and their sprites, which can be made to move across the screen during playback).
 2. Props
 3. Background images
 4. Audio recordings (I used 2012 Calvin Rien's SavWav.cs file to handle saving and creating audio files).
